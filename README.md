A Chart, also called Graph, is a graphical representation of data in which data is represented by symbols such as bars, lines, bubbles etc. Using MpAndroidChart Library, we can draw various graph but focus of this tutorial will be on Bar chart. A Bar Chart is a diagram in which the numerical values of variables are represented by the height or length of lines or rectangles of equal width. This Library works for Android API 8 and above but if we are using animations, it needs API 11 and above.
